The push button counter program developed in MPLAB X IDE utilizes a PIC18 microcontroller to count the number of times a button is pressed and display the count on an LCD. The circuit, designed in Proteus, includes the microcontroller, two push buttonsâ€”one for incrementing the count and another for resetting it and an LCD for visual output. The program initializes the LCD and continuously checks the state of the buttons. When the increment button is pressed, the count increases, and the updated value is displayed on the LCD after clearing the previous output. A debounce mechanism is implemented to ensure accurate counting by preventing multiple counts from a single button press. This project effectively demonstrates the integration of hardware and software in embedded systems, providing a practical application for learning microcontroller programming and circuit design.

In summary, this push button counter serves as a foundational exercise in embedded systems, showcasing essential concepts such as input handling, display control, and debouncing. The combination of MPLAB X IDE for programming and Proteus for circuit simulation allows for effective visualization and testing of the design, making it an excellent project for beginners in microcontroller applications.
